## New Year New Resolutions

To me, resolutions have to be impactful and measurable. This avoids the goals like "I want to get healthier" or "I want be a better listener" and make me set clear, actionable, ACCOUNTABLE goals.

Last year's I achieved 2 of my 3 resolutions. That included:

- [x] Build a real world product that people would use
- [x] Join more groups and learn better leadership skills
- [ ] Choke Yimin out in BJJ

I haven't seen Yimin at the BJJ Gym since the new years...

Anyway, New year, new resolutions! Here's what I thought of:

- [x] Get a tech job! (Six Figures)
- [ ] Get someone to pay me $1+ from a product I built myself
- [ ] Write a consistent blog for 2025

## First Interview

Starting off the year strong, I interviewed at 2 start ups based in SF! In 2024 I had an interview rate of 100% (meaning I passed 100% of my interviews. Albeit that I only got 3 interviews XD).

This year I'm not so sure. My interview question was implementing every possible way of TicTacToe (similar to [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state/description/)). I bombed it. Did not understand the problem at all nor did I get any proper solution out. T^T. It's ok, chin up, and I now know what needs to be fixing.

Second interview went well. There wasn't any technical question yet but the founder asked me questions about resume, my history of building, technical struggles etc. He was trying to get a feel, if I was a great fit for the company or not. I was fairly confident, since I did build these things and I've always enjoyed talking about the technical complexity and areas of tech.

2024 was a year of Resume Optimization, 2025 will be the year of acing the interviews and MAKE THAT BREAD. I can already feel it, 2025 is going to be a great year. Happy new years!
