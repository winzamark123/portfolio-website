this is a topic i've wanted to write for quite some time. it has become more apparent now that i've worked
at 3 startups in my career.

## Polar Founders

As I've gained more experience in the startup world of SF, an emerging trait I often see from founders are how polar they are on their
opinions. Naval says it best on <a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1996684253334327660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

and rightfully so. i think founders should indeed be polar as these are what investors are putting money on,
founder's decisions. you have to be polar on your vision since as a founder, that is the only thing you have.

## What is a founder?
or more specifically, what comprises a **founder**? theres a lot of material and writing out there on what a *great* founder is, but i want to take a step further back, a step in which i, myself keep looping back and forth on. what is a founder?

what discerns me, a founding engineer working at a startup from the founder?

i think a founder, at its most simple core, consist of these 3 main traits.
- a person who is convicted in their idea
- malleable enough to change their path on achieving that idea
- and brave enough to try

that is it. raising money, hiring, coding, all of these are just steps to creating a company. what makes a **founder** is just 3 simple traits. if you have an idea, that you believe can work, you are brave enough to try, and stubborn and smart enough to iterate as the market gives you more information, then you are a founder.
