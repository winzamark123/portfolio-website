title: Note to self for 2026
columns: 4
---

This is a note to self for the year of 26. This year is the year of the horse. People say this is a year of action. A horse runs, it gallops and races. This is not a year of overthinking but a year of abundant action.

I am currently on the plane 2 am in SF. Instead of sleeping I think a better time of my use is to think critically and plan what I truly want in 2026. It's hard to see what specific future lies ahead but it might be easier to pick up past trends of my past dots. As they say, "it is easier to connect the dots backward"

## Let's see.. in 2025 I've,

- Worked at an illegal startup, the founder was a guy who founded tabs chocolate. Incredible guy, but it wasn't what I truly wanted to do. Felt like agency work when I want more tech.
- Graduated, brought both yaya and my parents to the US for the first time. We went to Las Vegas, watched some shows, gambled, got an WSOP card. Showed them some incredible places but not enough.
- Joined an AI start up in SF. Also another incredible founder from Singapore, one of the best team and mentors I've ever had. I still talk to one of my co-worker, an AI engineer that I truly love and respect. We are pitching YC together
- Brought yaya over to SF. She's studying Masters in Design, a major she loves and life has been incredible with her. We got an apartment near Japantown and designing our room, picking furniture, lights, etc. What was to me an empty, barish, apartment has become a home that I look forward to going back even when I'm on vacation.
- Got an influx of inbound recruiters and made a radical decision to switch company after 6 months. The pay is better, the founders are young, smart, and truly hardworking. I still debate a lot whether this is the right move. After many conversations, faith and doubts. I've decided to stick with it. There's things to learn everywhere, why not do it at a place where they pay well.

That brings us to the start of this year. 2025 was an incredible year of grind and work. It was one of the most propelling year for my career and I can't help but wonder if 2026 would be the same. Should it be? While this has been an incredibly fulfilling year, I can't help but notice that I've also sacrificed some other aspects of things that life could be.

## So let's do a checklist.

#### What I'm happy with
- Relationship
- Family


#### What I want to focus on
- Health
- Financial freedom
- Living life fully

## A Unicorn Year

Horses doesn't just gallop and run. Only tunneled vision trained horses do, and I will never be a track horse. Funny, my girlfriend is born on the year of the horse and that means bad luck this year, but she believes that she's a unicorn and I believe this year is the same. A unicorn year. They are free. They explore. I think this year this is what I want to focus on. Of course, the grind is still there, I'll work my ass off, but on the right things. This is a year where I explore new hobbies, cities, and maybe career opportunities where I least expect.

I want to keep resolutions into another inference. There's a matter of reflecting on old resolutions as well. But this year I want to try sticking to a phrase.

Let's make this year a year where I **"live the shit out of life"**. Enjoy every moment, good or bad. A year where we push the pedals, where we enjoy taking turns and corners, where accidents are joked about, and a year where I am truly present to where I am.
