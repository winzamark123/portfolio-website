2025 was one of the most accelerating year for me. I've
- [x] Moved to a new city
- [x] Worked at 3 startups
- [x] Achieved my financial goal set at the start of the year
- [x] Moved in with a very special person in my life
- [x] Realized how special this person is to me

## Pondering before 2026
These are just but a few things that i'm reflecting on now, and i'm sure i'll be updating this list as for the foreseeable future.
Now there are also many things that i've come to realize and i think 2026 will be a year of clarity. Here are some things
i'm still pondering as of the moment.
- At what point can you say that you have enough experience to start a company? Does that truly matter at all? In this current
day where anyone can prompt claude for coding and more 10x, 100xs engineers emerge, is my skill as a SWE diminishing or
amplifying?
- Sequential to that, which path should i take to maximize my efforts? Do i go down the deep mind-boggling path of trying to
understand ai? or should i instead focus on things that are somewhat perpendicular? and which fields are truly perpendicular to ai?
* Note: an interesting field I think that is somewhat tangent to ai is marketing. People think that marketing is fully creative but
i think it runs deeper than that. Marketing is understanding the psychology of humans in groups, it combines both creativeness and
psychology, predicting on how a person / group might respond to a piece of creativeness created by the company.
This i believe, is not yet able to be automated by ai, and rightfully so, humans are not yet able to fully understand trends, and that
might be the bet companies like Cluely are trying to take. (Virality as a product). But who knows? when ai was first released
we thought that creative works like digital art, videos, and designs wouldn't be the first to be automated and yet here we are with
Midjourney, Sora, and loveable. Arguably, the most affect market was the coding market out of all.


Do simple things. Simple things are efficient, they are not a product of being stagnant and lazy but a proof
of multiple iterations of cycle. We should always keep things simpler than we feel like it should. There is elegance in simplicity, whether thats your set up, code, or relationship. I guess Santa was right, less is more.


It's funny because I've always followed this rule in my relationship, keeping things as lean and simple as possible and that has worked great for me. Yet I've never stopped, planned, and iterate on my day to day life efficiency.

Maybe I'm doing that now.

A lot of my blogs are rambles and updates of my life. This isn't particularly useful for anyone but me. Although there is a milestone where hopefully someone find clarity in reading these blogs, the more prominent goal for me is to improve my skills of putting thoughts into word. And what better way to do this than writing? As I've mentioned in previous blogs, writing is the simplest form of communication, so I've thought of trying to master this. Maybe it should rather be a series instead, a journal or a script for my short form stories.

Although meeting my current bosses (2 incredible founders), I've realized my use of vocabularies is subpar, along with
my hindered attention span due to social media. To improve on both, I've decided to read more, not those short form
tweets or video, actual long form content where i can really slow down the pace of what im doing and enjoy the moment.

### Ask for forgiveness not permission
A big lesson I learned transitioning from School to Work. We are ultimately responsible for our own success, so be proactive in the approach of what you do and what you want. Dont hinder or slow down your pace by asking for permission, nobody owes anyone anything. This is an important reminder i find myself alluding back to whenever i am trying to decide on anything.

An interesting paradigm shift that I've been pondering on is the idea of "Doing it for the lore." Experiencing life
as something that you would be proud to tell your children about. "Your dad to be a bartender, he used to work at a
sperm racing company, he went on this crazy backpacking trip across Himalayas, tried to start a company, etc."

I think thats something that I want to achieve. Ofcourse, this comes with financial stability, but having somewhat
achieved that (I still have to work but the pay is comfy), I think the next step is to focus on the things that you
yourself will tell others about, your _lore_.

## Polar Founders

As I've gained more experience in the startup world of SF, an emerging trait I often see from founders are how polar they are on their
opinions. Naval says it best on <a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1996684253334327660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
And it seems like this is a quality I lack--**Conviction**.
