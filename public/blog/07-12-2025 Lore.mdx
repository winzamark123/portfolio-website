title: Do it for the Lore
---

Do simple things. Simple things are efficient, they are not a product of being stagnant and lazy but a proof
of multiple iterations of cycle. We should always keep things simpler than we feel like it should. There is elegance in simplicity, whether thats your set up, code, or relationship. I guess Santa was right, less is more.


It's funny because I've always followed this rule in my relationship, keeping things as lean and simple as possible and that has worked great for me. Yet I've never stopped, planned, and iterate on my day to day life efficiency.

Maybe I'm doing that now.

A lot of my blogs are rambles and updates of my life. This isn't particularly useful for anyone but me. Although there is a milestone where hopefully someone find clarity in reading these blogs, the more prominent goal for me is to improve my skills of putting thoughts into word. And what better way to do this than writing? As I've mentioned in previous blogs, writing is the simplest form of communication, so I've thought of trying to master this. Maybe it should rather be a series instead, a journal or a script for my short form stories.

Although meeting my current bosses (2 incredible founders), I've realized my use of vocabularies is subpar, along with
my hindered attention span due to social media. To improve on both, I've decided to read more, not those short form
tweets or video, actual long form content where i can really slow down the pace of what im doing and enjoy the moment.

### Ask for forgiveness not permission 
A big lesson I learned transitioning from School to Work. We are ultimately responsible for our own success, so be proactive in the approach of what you do and what you want. Dont hinder or slow down your pace by asking for permission, nobody owes anyone anything. This is an important reminder i find myself alluding back to whenever i am trying to decide on anything.

An interesting paradigm shift that I've been pondering on is the idea of "Doing it for the lore." Experiencing life
as something that you would be proud to tell your children about. "Your dad to be a bartender, he used to work at a
sperm racing company, he went on this crazy backpacking trip across Himalayas, tried to start a company, etc."

I think thats something that I want to achieve. Ofcourse, this comes with financial stability, but having somewhat
achieved that (I still have to work but the pay is comfy), I think the next step is to focus on the things that you
yourself will tell others about, your _lore_.

## Polar Founders

As I've gained more experience in the startup world of SF, an emerging trait I often see from founders are how polar they are on their
opinions. Naval says it best on <a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1996684253334327660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
And it seems like this is a quality I lack--**Conviction**.
