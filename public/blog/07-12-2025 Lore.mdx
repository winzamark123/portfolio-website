title: Do it for the Lore
---

Lately I've been pondering over the idea of what it means to be ahead in life. It seems like I've been
taking my understanding of life being ahead financially as a benchmark for success. I'm sure most young people
starting off in life have the same notion as well.

Funny, I often thought about the difference between
**Extrinsic** and **Intrinsic** values and how much it takes one person to start valuing one over the other. 
You can see most tech billionaires became rich through extrinsic means, but after they achieved material success,
they start to value intrinsic things more and more.

While reflecting on how far you've come is not a bad thing to do from time to time.
I think what's most important is understand and realize what you want and the steps
to achieve them.

An interesting paradigm shift that I've been pondering on is the idea of "Doing it for the lore." Experiencing life
as something that you would be proud to tell your children about. "Your dad to be a bartender, he used to work at a
sperm racing company, he went on this crazy backpacking trip across Himalayas, tried to start a company, etc."

I think thats something that I want to achieve. Ofcourse, this comes with financial stability, but having somewhat
achieved that (I still have to work but the pay is comfy), I think the next step is to focus on the things that you
yourself will tell others about, your _lore_.

## Polar Founders

As I've gained more experience in the startup world of SF, an emerging trait I often see from founders are how polar they are on their
opinions. Naval says it best on <a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1996684253334327660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
And it seems like this is a quality I lack--**Conviction**.
