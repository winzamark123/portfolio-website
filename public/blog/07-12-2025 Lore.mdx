title: Do it for the Lore
---

Do simple things. Simple things are efficient, they are not a product of being stagnant and lazy but a proof
of multiple iterations of cycle. We should always keep things simple whether thats your set up, code, or relationship.
It's funny because I've always followed this rule in my relationship, keeping things as lean and simple as possible
and that has worked great for me. Yet I've never stopped, planned, and iterate on my day to day life efficiency.
Maybe I'm doing that now.

A lot of my blogs are rambles and updates of my life. This isn't particularly useful for anyone but me. Although there
is a milestone where hopefully someone find clarity in reading these blogs, the more prominent goal for me is to
improve my skills of putting thoughts into word. And what better way to do this than writing? As I've mentioned in
previous blogs, writing is the simplest form of communication, so I've thought of trying to master this.

Although meeting my current bosses (2 incredible founders), I've realized my use of vocabularies is subpar, along with
my hindered attention span due to social media. To improve on both, I've decided to read more, not those short form
tweets or video, actual long form content where i can really slow down the pace of what im doing and enjoy the moment.

Lately I've been pondering over the idea of what it means to be ahead in life. It seems like I've been
taking my understanding of life being ahead financially as a benchmark for success. I'm sure most young people
starting off in life have the same notion as well.

Funny, I often thought about the difference between
**Extrinsic** and **Intrinsic** values and how much it takes one person to start valuing one over the other.
You can see most tech billionaires became rich through extrinsic means, but after they achieved material success,
they start to value intrinsic things more and more.

While reflecting on how far you've come is not a bad thing to do from time to time.
I think what's most important is understand and realize what you want and the steps
to achieve them.

An interesting paradigm shift that I've been pondering on is the idea of "Doing it for the lore." Experiencing life
as something that you would be proud to tell your children about. "Your dad to be a bartender, he used to work at a
sperm racing company, he went on this crazy backpacking trip across Himalayas, tried to start a company, etc."

I think thats something that I want to achieve. Ofcourse, this comes with financial stability, but having somewhat
achieved that (I still have to work but the pay is comfy), I think the next step is to focus on the things that you
yourself will tell others about, your _lore_.

## Polar Founders

As I've gained more experience in the startup world of SF, an emerging trait I often see from founders are how polar they are on their
opinions. Naval says it best on <a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1996684253334327660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
And it seems like this is a quality I lack--**Conviction**.
