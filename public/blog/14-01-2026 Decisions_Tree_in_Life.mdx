title: Decision Tree in Life
---
One of the most under appreciate skills in my life is the ability to make decisions. This is something I've always thought
about but never truly dived into. A skill i've assumed to only grows as more experience and intuition builds up over the years.

Something that became adamant to me though this skill of "deciding" is not limited to the choices itself but also includes the timing
of when you pick those decisions.

```
Bob picks a city to live in when he started his career. SF with its abundance of talent and center of the tech industry. While Bill
chose to stay in Thailand, with its rich culture and comfortable lifestyle. 5 years later, Bob sold his company at a valuation of
9 figures while Bill still works for CP.
```

Now succeess can differ depending on people and these two choices are good choices, neither are bad, 
But a type A person (like most people) in SF might prefer to hit it big before heading back home to 
relax -- i also fall into this bucket as well.

What i suspect and am trying to infer is that some decisions really depends on the timing of your life and the younger you are the
the bigger the risk appetite and the more important it is to pick a decision that has the ability to compound over the years. 

what kind of decisions compounds over the years? there are a couple of examples that come to mind.
- **skills**
    - if your choices are optimize for learning, there will alwawys bne a path to earning money. a cool example to this is 
    how Steve Jobs was into caligraphy -- a seemingly useless skill that turned out to be one of the most impactful 
    philosophy that shapes how Apple operates today.

- **relationships**
    - a healthy and stable relationship will lessen your worries and push you towards moving to the right direction. i cant beleive
    how much time and brain capacity is wasted thinking about forming human connections. Whenever I talk to many of my friends who are
    still single (or in a rough relationship) the only things they think about is how to find a companion. Maybe there is a survivor bias in 
    these people causing people who think about these things all the time to fail in finding proper loving relationship.

    - dont waste half your time and half your brain chasing, once you are ready the time will come and when it does, love them tightly

    - another big reason to care about these relationships are so that you don't have any regrets when charging towards your goals. you can
    accelerate and tunnel vision yourself knowing that the people behind you got your back.

- **perspective**
    - traveling has got to be one of the best tools to compound this. every single time i've traveled to a different country, visited a new place
    my perspective has expanded. traveling also gives you the ability to become a different person which can make you shift our of your comfort zone. 
    now whether traveling with another person will do that or not, this is something i would like to experience with Yaya this year. 

- **health**
    - healthier more in shape people are more confident, and more confident people are likely to open themselves up to new opportunities.
    - physically you also get to do things when you are much healthier that is just an internal fact -- hiiking, skiinng, swimming etc, 
    the healthier you are the more options you have in life.

- **clarity (the ability to make good decisions)**
    this is probably the most important yet least thought about. the ability to make decisions. its like in a video game when you can see
    in the future of what your decisions will lead to. buying this set of armor or leveling up this set of power. its surprising because
    im always someone who tries to make the best choices in the game. sometimes when i know the choices lead to a bad ending i restart and reset
    to the checkpoint. Yet, i've never thought about it much in real life. Partly could be due to the fact that there is no checkpoint in life,
    and maybe thats the reason why the mindset shifts to YOLO but it should be the opposite, i should sit a reflect on why these decisions are made
    and what were the outcomes of those decisions.
    
    now here is where i think people get things wrong. they judge decisions based on the output not the input. this is effectively saying that 
    all in with 72s and hitting the nuts is always the best choice, when optimally its incorrect. what we need to do in judging right or wrong 
    decisions is based entirely on the input.
    
    now what categorize as a good inputs of decisions, what criterias should i use to judge what is a good decision?
    here are some brainstorms:
    - potential upsdie? but no that would mean that buying a lottery ticket is a good decision.  but taking bets on investments
    are good decisions so whyh is buying a lottery ticket not?
