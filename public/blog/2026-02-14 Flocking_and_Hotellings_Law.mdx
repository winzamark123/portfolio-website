ever wonder why there are certain districts that sell one type of product?

in New york theres Thompson Street for the **chess district**, 
in Japan theres Kappabashi Street for the **kitchenware district**,
in Thailand theres Pak Khlong Talat for the **flower district**.
in Amsterdam theres the famous **Red Light District** :3

it seems rather unintuitive that these stores would flock together in the same area even though
there would be more competition. a product could and probably would have to sell at half the price 
in a district where there is essentially what economist would say as "perfect competition". 
if i were to open any shop that has sells the same category as the district my initial reaction 
is to open as far away as possible from these stores. 

for easier reference i want to coin this phenomenon as *flocking*, 
where similar product, services, or attributes flock together in the same area.

researching this, there are some logical answers to *flocking*, but the cool thing i 
found out recently and wanted to share here is that theres also a *mathematical* answer 
to this question! 

alot of the answers can be found here on this 
[reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1lzft8/why_do_certain_metropolitan_areas_turn_into/)
, but for those in for my explanation, here it is:

#### Logical Intuition 
if you were a foreigner visiting Thailand and wanted to get some fun action, what would be the first
place you would think of? Certainly not the rural area of Bangkok, but the famous red light
district of Pattaya. Why? because you know that the area is known for these type of services, in a way
it guarantees quality, saves you time, and gives you a sense of security that you won't be scammed 
in terms of pricing. 

and that is essentially it. when thinking in terms of the customers, district allows the leveraged increase
of traffic. A district might have 30 stores, making store owners likely have to halve their prices but with 
the tradeoffs of having 30 times the traffic. (not literally, but it definitely is a significant tradeoffs), 
customers would also have a higher trust in the product since the reputation of the district boosts the
reputation of your stores as well. 

there are more nuances and specific examples on the occurences of **flocking** that i'll gloss over. things like:
- resources in the area 
- security in the herds (i.e. diamond stores in the NY diamond district gets a lower percentage of robbery than those outside the district)
- the ability to share information and resources between stores (i.e. sharing suppliers, sharing customers, etc)
- and more

#### Mathematical Explanation
the interesting thing about **flocking** that can also be explained mathematically is the concept of **Hotelling's Law**. 

to explain this: 
lets imagine a singular line (a street) where there are homes all throughout the street. 
hot dog cart vendors wants to sell the hotdogs on this street. 

1 hot dog cart opens on the street, where should they choose the location? it doesnt matter. since their
product is currently inherently unique, customers will have to come to the store no matter how far 
down the street they are 

now a second store opens up, where should the stores now choose their location? the optimal location
people are expecting are both ends of the street (where they are furthest apart), therefore both stores
will capture half of the market. now with both carts at the end of the street, 
the house in the middle can decide whether to go for the hot dog cart on the left or the 
hot dog cart on the right, since the distance are equivalent.

but what happens if cart B (the cart of the right side of the street) moves in closer to the middle of the street? now the distance between 
the middle house and cart B is shorter, while the end of the street is further away, but no matter
what, the distance of cart B will always be closer than the distance of cart A when compared by the right 
end of the street. therefore cart B also captures the middle house share of the market. 

naturally cart A seeing this will also move closer to the middle of the street to prevent cart B from capturing
a bigger share of the market. this process continues until both of them ended up next to each other in the
middle of the street. 

i think that is what we unintuitive ignored about **flocking**. the optimal location of the carts on a street
is at the both ends of the street BUT it is also optimal for both stores to be at the middle of the street.
in fact, this is called the **Nash Equlibrium** -- a concept in game theory where no players can improve their 
position since alternative strategies would lead to a worse outcome for themselves. (cart b choosing to move further away
from the middle results in cart A capturing more of the market share)

this concept also applies to 3 stores in a 2D plane and more. in the end, the Nash Equlibrium of the stores 
opening up in a location results in the creation of districts and the phenomenon of **flocking**!
