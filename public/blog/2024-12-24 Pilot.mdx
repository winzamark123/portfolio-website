Going into 2025, one of my new year resolution is to become a better writer. Inspired by Paul Graham's essay on [Write and Write Nots](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html), I am challenging myself to become a better writer and thus a better thinker. I don't expect much traction from these blogs as these are just some notes to self, but if you are reading this, hopefully you might get some small nuggets of stories, knowledge, and inspiration.

**Happy Christmas Eve!**
