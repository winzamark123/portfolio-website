title: Products that Lasts
---

This day and age, AI makes building product from 0 -> 1 relatively easy. Any products can be easily replaced by a product that does something better. So what's the MOAT?

Products that utilizes networks effect.

That is why incumbents like LinkedIN, Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook are so hard to beat.
For humans it is hard to migrate off a network you already love.

## Network Effects

There are many cases and examples of network effects. Most commons are the typical social media platforms we know and love.
In this blog, I want to explore the network effects that are not so obvious.

### School of Electric Vehicles

Our current road is dominated by cars driven by humans. With some exceptions of Autonomous driving such as Tesla and Waymo.
And this is expected, our technology is not yet at the point where autonomous cars are safe and reliable. There are still many
liabilities and risks that comes from a non-human driven car. But this will shift in the near future.
Not just the technology of car safety and infrastructure will rise, but as more autonomous cars are deployed on the road,
the liabilities will soon shift towards humans being negligent in driving.

What is interesting here is the network effect of the school of electric vehicles. Much like a _school of fish_ (school - refers to a group of fish),
swimming together. The more electric vehicles are on the road, the more the network effect will be.

When cars are driven synchronously, it reduces traffic, accidents, and increases efficiency of traveling between destinations. A autonomous electric vehicle
shifting in from a lane or merging into the highway, joins the network of electric vehicles and becomes part of the network.

This is an interesting network effect that is not so obvious. And I can definitely see it being a huge bet to take for the future.

### GPUs

- I've realized building products that lasts
