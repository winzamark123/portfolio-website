## What's something you've changed your mind on in the past year?

It's been a couple weeks since I started my first job. It's a Software Engineer Position at a startup.
I hate to admit this, but my experience here led me to believe that it doesn't require a huge amount of technical skill to build a product with paying users. Especially for your early adopters, users pay for a product they _believe_ works.

And this is where I was fooled. As I trust that most developers also commonly fall into this trap. The trap of building a perfect product so that not only the users will trust us but we ourselves can trust the product in which we are building and selling to them. The perfect UI, UX, backend architecture, system scaling etc.

Developers often try to take the path of an **Inventor** since that is what engineers do, we invent, scale, and inspire not only ourselves but other people to the allusion of futures.

But I think in a startup instead of taking the path of an **Inventor** we should in a way also take up the role of a **Magician**. Users will pay for a product they _believe_ will work. And in the early stages of a startup where you don't have the funding nor the time to spend on creating the future, sometimes a mix of illusion will help tip over the edge.

- Maybe from the perspective of a normal users this all looks the same. The product acts as intended and thus _beliefs_ are solidified.
- Maybe that means that we developers should try to fool ourselves. I know this is often hard since we understand how the product works as a whole, and it's hard to sell something that we know is inherently faulty.

Ultimately, my goal this year is to build a product that users will pay to use. And sometimes that means fooling myself into believing in a _work-in-progress user-validated solutions_ rather than begging for users to try out a fully built solution that no one has a problem to.
