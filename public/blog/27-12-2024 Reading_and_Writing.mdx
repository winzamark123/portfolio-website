title: Reading and Writing
---

The more I read [Paul Graham's essays](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html), the more I realize that one's ability to **write** corresponds with their ability to **think**. To be able to express and explain your feelings, mindset, or line of thought, a person needs to be able think concisely and clearly, even more-so when the only form of expression comes through words read through a paper/website.

This reminds of the scene in Billions from Taylor Mason

_"I understand how hard it is to have things inside you that you can't communicate, I can't imagine how hard it must be to know HOW to say them and still NOT be allowed to"_ - Taylor Mason

Writing is the most refined form of thinking, **conversely** reading is the most refined form of learning. No wonder they say all successful people read a ton.
